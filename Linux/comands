### **Learning Tips**
1. **Start Small**: Focus on the most commonly used commands first (`ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, etc.).
2. **Practice**: Use these commands in your daily work or practice environment.
3. **Use `man` Pages**: Whenever you're unsure about a command or its options, use `man <command>` to read its manual.
4. **Create Cheat Sheets**: Write down the commands you use most often as a quick reference.
5. **Build on What You Learn**: Once you're comfortable, explore more advanced options and commands.

These basics will cover most of what you need to do in a typical Linux environment. As you get more comfortable, you can dive into more advanced commands and scripting.
