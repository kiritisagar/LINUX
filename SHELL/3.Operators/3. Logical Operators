These are used to combine conditional statements.

a.AND: `&&`
  if [ "$a" -eq 1 ] && [ "$b" -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "a is 1 and b is 2"
  fi

b.OR: `||`
  if [ "$a" -eq 1 ] || [ "$b" -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "Either a is 1 or b is 2"
  fi
  
c.NOT: `!`
  if ! [ "$a" -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "a is not 1"
  fi
