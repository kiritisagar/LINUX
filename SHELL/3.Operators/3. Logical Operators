These are used to combine conditional statements.

- **AND**: `&&`
  ```bash
  if [ "$a" -eq 1 ] && [ "$b" -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "a is 1 and b is 2"
  fi
  ```

- **OR**: `||`
  ```bash
  if [ "$a" -eq 1 ] || [ "$b" -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "Either a is 1 or b is 2"
  fi
  ```

- **NOT**: `!`
  ```bash
  if ! [ "$a" -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "a is not 1"
  fi
  ```
