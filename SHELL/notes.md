   - The first line specifies the interpreter to use, like Bash.
   - Add your commands below it.

   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"

Types of Expressions
# Arithmetic Operations:

You can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Example:
a=5
b=3
sum=$(expr $a + $b)        # Addition
diff=$(expr $a - $b)       # Subtraction
product=$(expr $a \* $b)   # Multiplication (escape the * with a backslash)
quotient=$(expr $a / $b)    # Division
echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $diff"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient
'
