# Variable:
A variable is a container that holds a value. 
The value of a variable can change during the execution of the script. 
Variables can store different types of data, such as text (strings), numbers, or other values

# Declaring and Using Variables
variables are created by simply assigning a value to a name. 

## Basic Syntax
variable_name=value

No spaces around the = sign.
Variable names are typically uppercase by convention, but lowercase is also allowed.


# types of variables:
1.Local Variables
2. Global Variables
3. Environment Variables
4. Positional Parameters
5. Special Variables
6. Array Variables

Special Variables



1.Local Variables
Variables that are defined within a script or a function and are not accessible outside of it.

2. Global Variables
Variables that are accessible anywhere within the script after they have been declared.

3. Environment Variables
Variables that are available system-wide and can affect the behavior of the shell and other programs. They are typically exported and can be accessed by any script or process.

4. Positional Parameters
Definition: Special variables that hold the arguments passed to the script or function. They are accessed using $1, $2, ..., $N.
  
5. Special Variables
Predefined variables that have special meanings and are set by the shell.

Common Special Variables:
$0: The name of the script.
$#: The number of arguments passed to the script.
$@: All the arguments passed to the script.
$?: The exit status of the last command executed.
$$: The process ID of the current shell.
$_: The last argument of the previous command.

6. Array Variables
Variables that can hold multiple values indexed by a number.

NOTE:
Declaring Variables: variable_name=value
Using Variables: Access with $variable_name
Arithmetic Operations: Use $((expression))
Strings and Concatenation: Use variables within strings with $variable_name
User Input: Read with read variable_name
Environment Variables: Export with export variable_name=value
Unset Variables: Use unset variable_name

ARRAY:
collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations
